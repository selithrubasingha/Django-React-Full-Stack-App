# Full Stack Web Application (React + Django + REST Framework)

## Overview
This project is a **full-stack web application** built using **React (frontend)** and **Django REST Framework (backend)**.  
It was developed by following a tutorial by *Tech With Tim*, but through the process, I explored and understood the **entire lifecycle of building and deploying** a modern web application — from backend logic to frontend integration and deployment. 

It was fascinating to learn how to actually connect the backend to the fronend and the wensite hosting part , this is my firstever fullstack app and motivated me to explore this path even further !

##  Tech Stack

### 🖥️ Frontend
- **React.js** (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
- **Axios** for API requests
- **React Router** for frontend routing and navigation

### ⚙️ Backend
- **Django** (Python web framework)
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for creating RESTful APIs
- **JWT Authentication** for secure communication between frontend and backend

### ☁️ Deployment
- **Choreo by WSO2** — used to host both frontend and backend services seamlessly

##  What I Learned

### 1. Understanding Full Stack Architecture
I learned how the **frontend and backend communicate** through RESTful APIs and how data flows between the client and the server.

### 2. Working with Django REST Framework
- Creating and serializing models using DRF.
- Structuring REST endpoints and handling HTTP methods.
- Implementing **authentication and permission handling** using DRF’s built-in tools.

### 3. JWT Authentication
One of the biggest learning points was understanding how **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** work:
- Generating tokens upon login.
- Storing and validating tokens in the frontend.
- Protecting routes and securing API endpoints.

### 4. Connecting Frontend and Backend
I learned how to:
- Use **Axios** to send and receive data from the backend.
- Handle CORS and environment configurations.
- Synchronize authentication flow between React and Django.

### 5. Deployment with Choreo
Hosting the entire application on **Choreo by WSO2** taught me how to:
- Deploy both frontend and backend services.
- Manage API gateways and environment variables.
- Handle real-world deployment challenges.

## 🧩 Features
- User authentication (login and signup) using JWT.
- Secure communication between frontend and backend.
- RESTful API endpoints built with Django REST Framework.
